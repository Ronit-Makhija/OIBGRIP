        <p>Rob had worked with some of the other members of the USA basketball team before, but this would be his<br> first interaction with Kobe. It was so powerful, that he shared it with the world on Reddit so everyone could<br> get a glimpse into Kobe Bryant's insane work ethic.<br><br>Here is his <span class="golden">story:</span><br><br>In his first meeting with Kobe, Rob Lalked about what he specialized in, where Kobe would like to be by the end<br> of summer, and about the hustle of his teammates Rob then gave Kobe his number and told him to call him any<br> time he wanted to do some extra conditioning work.<br><br>Two days later, Kobe wake wo Rab with a call at 4:15am in the morning.<br><br>Hey, uhh Rob, I hope I'm not disturbing anything right?"<br><br>Uhh no, what's up Kobe."<br><br>"Just wondering if you could just help me out with some conditioning work, that's all."<br><br>"Yeah sure, I'll see you in the facility in a bit."<br><br>20 minutes later, Rob arrived at the training facility. There he saw Kobe-alone and drenched in so much sweat it </p>
        <p>looked like he'd just come from a pool. it was not even 5am yet!<br><br>The two of them worked on conditioning for about 75 minutes, then did about 45 minutes of weight training.<br><br>Then at 7am, Rob went back to his hotel to get some quick rest before the day's practice. Meanwhile, Kobe went<br> back to the gym to practice his shooting.<br><br>Rob was expected back at 11am. So he slept a couple of hows, got a quick breakfast, and then headed back to<br> the gym exhausted and sleep deprived.<br><br>
When he arrived, he saw all of the members of Team USA there Lebron was talking to Carmelo, Coach<br> Krzyzewski wes explaining something to Kevin Durant and, on the right side of the facility all by himself, Kobe<br> was shooting jumpers</p>
